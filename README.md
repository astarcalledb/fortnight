### Important things to Remember

* You need to tell Netlify about your repo

### Homework
* Create a new site locally with one file and one css file (very similar to what we did in class today)
* Push the site to Github (don't forget to git init, add, commit and push)
* Then tell Netlify about the site
* Rename the URL on Netlify to something easy to remember
* Then after adding and viewing your live site make a change, add an image to your site locally and see if you can remember how to update the live site
